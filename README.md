| neo4j_uri | Neo4j URI for Bolt protocol connections |
| neo4j_username | Username for Neo4j (always "neo4j") |
| instance_id | EC2 instance ID |

## Example Deployment

```bash
# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Review the plan
terraform plan -var="password=YourSecurePassword123" \
  -var="vpc_id=vpc-xxxxx" \
  -var="subnet_id=subnet-xxxxx"

# Apply the configuration
terraform apply -var="password=YourSecurePassword123" \
  -var="vpc_id=vpc-xxxxx" \
  -var="subnet_id=subnet-xxxxx"
```

Alternatively, create a `terraform.tfvars` file:

```hcl
password      = "YourSecurePassword123"
vpc_id        = "vpc-xxxxx"
subnet_id     = "subnet-xxxxx"
instance_type = "t3.large"
disk_size     = 50

tags = {
  Environment = "production"
  ManagedBy   = "terraform"
}
```

Then run:
```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Accessing Neo4j

### Neo4j Browser and Database Access

After deployment, you can access Neo4j using the outputs:

```bash
# Get the Neo4j Browser URL
terraform output neo4j_browser_url

# Get the Bolt connection URI
terraform output neo4j_uri
```

Default credentials:
- Username: `neo4j`
- Password: The password you provided in the `password` variable

### Instance Console Access via SSM Session Manager

This module uses AWS Systems Manager Session Manager for secure console access instead of SSH. No SSH keys or open port 22 required.

**Connect via AWS Console:**
1. Navigate to EC2 console
2. Select your Neo4j instance
3. Click "Connect" â†’ "Session Manager" tab
4. Click "Connect"

**Connect via AWS CLI:**
```bash
# Get the instance ID
INSTANCE_ID=$(terraform output -raw instance_id)

# Start a session
aws ssm start-session --target $INSTANCE_ID
```

**Prerequisites for CLI access:**
- AWS CLI v2 installed
- Session Manager plugin installed: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html
- Appropriate IAM permissions for SSM

**Note:** The subnet where the instance is deployed must have:
- Either a NAT Gateway/Instance for internet access, OR
- VPC endpoints for SSM services (ssm, ssmmessages, ec2messages)

## EBS Snapshots

The module supports automated daily EBS snapshots using AWS Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM):

### Enabling Snapshots

Set the `snapshot_retention_days` parameter to a value greater than 0:

```hcl
module "neo4j" {
  source = "github.com/ilich/terraform-aws-neo4j-community"

  password                = "your-secure-password"
  vpc_id                  = "vpc-xxxxx"
  subnet_id               = "subnet-xxxxx"
  snapshot_retention_days = 30  # Keep daily snapshots for 30 days
}
```

### How It Works

- **Daily Schedule**: Snapshots are created daily at 03:00 UTC
- **Automatic Retention**: Snapshots are automatically deleted after the specified retention period
- **Tagging**: Snapshots are tagged with `SnapshotType=DLM`, `Service=Neo4j`, plus any custom tags
- **Target Identification**: The EBS volume is tagged with `neo4j-snapshot=true` for DLM targeting
- **IAM Role**: An IAM role is automatically created for DLM with minimal required permissions

### Disabling Snapshots

Set `snapshot_retention_days = 0` (default) or omit the parameter entirely:

```hcl
module "neo4j" {
  source = "github.com/ilich/terraform-aws-neo4j-community"

  password  = "your-secure-password"
  vpc_id    = "vpc-xxxxx"
  subnet_id = "subnet-xxxxx"
  # snapshot_retention_days = 0  # Default - snapshots disabled
}
```

### Cost Considerations

- EBS snapshot costs are based on the amount of data stored
- Snapshots are incremental, so subsequent snapshots only store changed data
- Review AWS EBS pricing for your region: https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/pricing/

## Security Considerations

1. **Instance Access**: No SSH access - uses AWS Systems Manager Session Manager for secure console access
2. **Neo4j Ports**: Ports 7474 and 7687 are open to 0.0.0.0/0 by default. Consider restricting to specific IP ranges by modifying the security group
3. **Password**: Use a strong password (minimum 8 characters) and store it securely (e.g., in AWS Secrets Manager)
4. **Encryption**: EBS volumes are encrypted by default using AWS-managed keys
5. **IAM Permissions**: The instance has minimal IAM permissions (only SSM access via AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore policy)
6. **Cypher Security**: Internal network IP blocklist is configured to prevent SSRF attacks via Cypher queries
7. **AMI**: Uses Amazon Linux 2023 AMI (al2023-ami-2023.9.20250929.0-kernel-6.1-x86_64) with lifecycle policy to ignore AMI changes

## Supported Regions

This module includes AMI mappings for the following AWS regions:
- US: us-east-1, us-east-2, us-west-1, us-west-2
- EU: eu-north-1, eu-west-1, eu-west-2, eu-west-3, eu-central-1
- AP: ap-south-1, ap-northeast-1, ap-northeast-2, ap-northeast-3, ap-southeast-1, ap-southeast-2
- CA: ca-central-1
- SA: sa-east-1

If deployed in an unsupported region, the module will fall back to the us-east-1 AMI.
